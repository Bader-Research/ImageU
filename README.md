# ImageU: Parallel Combinatorial Algorithms

This code provides efficient and portable implementations of useful
image processing algorithms, histogramming, connected components,
image enhancement, and segmentation, as well parallel codes for
combinatorial problems such as routing h-relations, sorting and
selection. The algorithms have been coded in Split-C and provide the
best known execution times for these approaches, even when compared
with machine specific implementations.
